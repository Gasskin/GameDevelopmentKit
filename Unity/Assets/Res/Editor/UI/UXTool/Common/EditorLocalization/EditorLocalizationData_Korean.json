Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to our services; any transmission of your information is at your own risk.\n\n\nData Retention\nWe will retain most of your personal information for the lifetime of your use of the Service (i.e. until account deletion in accordance with your request) except that Contact Information obtained from promotional activities will be retained during the lifetime of such activities.\nIn the event that the processing and retention period have terminated, but personal information is required to be retained continuously for other reasons including for the purposes as prescribed under applicable laws, the relevant personal information will be stored and maintained separately from other types of personal information. If you require us to destroy your personal information before the end of its life cycle, we will destroy your personal information in accordance with local laws.\n\n\nYour Rights\nThis section (“Your Rights”) applies to users that are located in the European Economic Area only.

Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).\nCorrection\nYou have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please contact us and complete the request form.\nErasure\nYou can delete your account, or remove certain personal information.

Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Service and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.\nRestriction of Processing to Storage Only\nYou have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.\nYou may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where:\n• you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate;\n• you wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal information but just store it instead; or\n• you wish to erase the personal information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nObjection\nYou have the right to object to our processing of personal information about you. We will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below by contact us and completing the request form.\nAnnouncements\nWe may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend The Service access for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications).
